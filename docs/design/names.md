Alternative names for the docker tool that manages multiple Docker compose stacks.

Was going to be called 'composer', but the name was already used for a popular PHP package manager.

Name needs to be short (CLI tool), memorable, and not too hard to read or say,
while not conflicting with common tools.

Sorted by order of most to least preferable, includes definition and any tools found that already use the name:

- gam (social gathering of whales! https://github.com/GAM-team/GAM is a popular Google Workspace cli tool, but usage unlikely to overlap)
- shoal (shallow water where whale groups gather; not used anywhere)
- grove (collection of trees; seems to be no competition)
- orca (chantal loves them; there is a security CLI named this, but no one seems to use it)
- herd (group of whales; a somewhat popular PHP developer tool)
- compote (mixture of fruits stewed together; a 'popular' ESP IoT tool)
- supercompose (long but memorable; a somewhat similar tool that takes a wildly different approach with that name that never took off https://github.com/jkelin/supercompose)
- stackctl (used by a cloud manager CLI tool that never took off)
- weave (interlacing stacks together; seems to be used for a few tools that aren't terribly popular)
- loom (interlacing stacks together; surprisingly does not seem to be used)
- deck (collection of stacks; shockingly does not seem to be used much)
- maestro (a unpopular CLI music player, and a popular UI testing tool)
- stackposer (medium length and awkward, but unique)
- dstack (a commercial AI stack manager tool has this name)
- pod (group of whales; popular tool for Windows package management, as well as extremely popular tool for MacOS dev for Swift/ObjC)
- baton (conductors tool; seems to be allot of tools with this name)
